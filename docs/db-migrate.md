#db migration

the db migration is done via `db-migrate` and `grunt-db-migrate`.
video demo available at http://youtu.be/Odw6YHCFDfw


## File structure

```
\database.json      # defines the database env
\---schema
    \---migrations  # all scripts are here
            20140826112659-baseline.js
```


## grunt config
A task called `dbmigrate` is registered in the gruntfile.
The task basically just runs `db-migrate up` command with property parameters.

A new config `migrate` is added to grunt as well where defines the parameters for the `db-migrate`.
For more info, refer to the inline comment.
